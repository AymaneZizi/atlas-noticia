        <p>Atlas da Notícia (News Atlas) is a pioneering project aimed at mapping the local and regional press in Brazil amidst the digital revolution. It is carried on through a partnership between <a href="https://www.projor.org.br/en" target="_blank">Projor – Instituto para o Desenvolvimento do Jornalismo</a> and <a href="https://www.voltdata.info/en-lg" target="_blank">Volt Data Lab</a>.
          </p>
        <p> Atlas is focused on identifying local outlets covering civic local subjects, such as public spending, local law making process, health, education, security, mobility and the environment. It has also been planned into incremental phases.
        </p>
        <p>Completed and published in November 2017, the first phase identified 5,354 news outlets (both print and digital) in 1,125 of a total of Brazilian 5,570 municipalities. Conversely, Atlas revealed the existence of so-called “news deserts” in 4,500 municipalities, home to 70 million people, some 35% of Brazilian population.
        </p>
        <p>The first phase has also delivered an open database and a report including <a href="www.observatoriodaimprensa.com.br/edicao/965" target="_blank">a series</a> of analytical texts, maps and charts published by Observatório da Imprensa, Projor’s media watchdog website.</p>
        <p>Atlas da Notícia is inspired by the <a href="https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american-news-deserts-donuts-local.php" target="_blank">America’s Growing Deserts of News</a> project, developed by the <a href="https://www.cjr.org/" target="_blank">Columbia Journalism Review</a> to map local newspapers in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>The second phase aims to improve Atlas' interactive platform and database and also to develop deeper on-site analytical research in a sample of “news deserts."

          </ul>
          <h3>Major cities disparities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Brazil's three main cities (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and the capital Brasilia) account for 1,112 mapped newspapers or websites, representing 20.7% of the total, although they have only some 10% of the national population.</li>
